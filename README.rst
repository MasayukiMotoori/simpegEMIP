SimPEG-EMIP is a simulation and inversion pacakge focusing on induced polarization (IP) effects in electromagnetic (EM) data. 
It is under an ecosystem of SimPEG: Simulation and Parameter Estimation in Geophysics, which is a python package for simulation and gradient based parameter estimation in the context of geophysical applications.

The vision is to understand induced polarization effects in various EM data, but particular focus is in time-domain inductive source EM data such as airborne EM.
